# Machine_Learning_playground
In this repository I go over some case-studies that involve the deployment of machine/deep learning algorithms in Python in order to train and evaluate models on both synthetic and real datasets. 



| Tool/Algorithm | Application  |
| -------------        | -------------
| Linear Regression    | Ecommerce data analytics|
| Logistic Regression  | Ad click prediction |    
| Multivariate Gaussian | Anomaly Detection for network servers |
| Polynomial/Linear Regression | Audio prediction |
| Principal Component Analysis | Dimensionality reduction for simple 2D dataset |
| Bayesian Linear Regression | Prediction of burnt calories from exercise length |
